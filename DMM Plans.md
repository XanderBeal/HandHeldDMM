Code To-Do
- speed problems 
    - MCU? Inefficient code? Slow ADC?
- cal function and control of cal (redefine interupt functions, one define fkor cal and another for ranges???)



- lieing about 16 bit res??








DMM circuit design V2

- two diffrent opamp power supplies to prevent adc over voltage
- adc conditioning redesign
- mux / analog switches insted of optocouplers in most spots
- ptc input protection (UL / safty rating ability??)
- seperate adc that is BIPOLAR and diffrential
- use touch screen
- usbc input and programing
- regulator and programer backfeed protection
- better SWD routing and FIXED swd programing header
- proper reset line debounceing circuit
- external crystal problems??? use diffrent MCU (just add new board to platform.ini and maybe boards folder)?????
- SEPERATE DIGITAL AND ANALOG BOARDS maybe power supply seperate 
- ACV and ACI functionality
- To Be Continued.....

- ohms adding measuremnet error, CC sourse needs isolation / control connection to input connection
